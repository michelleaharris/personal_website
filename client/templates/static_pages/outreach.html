          <p class="lead">Led a group of junior high girls on an activity teaching them about circuitry through connecting a battery to a motor on a breadboard. The girls built on some concepts learned in the solar cell activity to power a motor with a battery using connections on a bread board. <a href="http://www.projectexploration.org/2015/12/01/circuit-boards/">Check out their blog post!</a> </p>

          <p class="lead">Led a group of junior high girls on an activity teaching them about electromagnetic waves and building a simple radio from a kit. The girls were excited to build the radio and find their favorite station. This was their favorite activity of the year. At a year end event, the girls gave an amazing presentation on what they learned from the radio lab tackling complex concepts about the broad electromagnetic spectrum. <a href="https://sisters4science.wordpress.com/2015/05/07/radio-are-you-there-over/">Check out their blog post!</a> </p>

          <p class="lead">Led a group of junior high girls on an activity teaching them about solar energy and parallel and series circuits. The girls connected multiple perovskite solar cells, made in a freshman chemistry lab at Northwestern, in order to light an LED and measure the voltage of varying circuits. The girls enjoyed watching the brightness of the LED change depending on the light source, either artificial or natural light. <a href="https://sisters4science.wordpress.com/2015/04/08/solar-power-to-the-rescue/">Check out their blog post!</a> </p>
